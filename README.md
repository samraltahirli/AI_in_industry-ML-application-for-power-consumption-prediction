# ML applications for power consumption prediction



This project  aimed the building of  models to predict energy consumption.I used the result of a ten-year-long project to design a monitoring framework (EXAMON) deployed at the Italian supercomputers at CINECA datacenter as dataset.
## Approaches
Regression models are applied in this project

     3.Ridge

     4.ElasticNet
     
     5.RandomForestRegressor

     6.GradientBoostingRegressor

     7.DecisionTreeRegressor
